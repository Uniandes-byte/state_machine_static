# remote_controller
This is a simple program that allows the user to control Pepper's base and head movement using the KeyBoard (W,A,S,D for base and I,J,K,L for the head). It also allows to send strings to be reproduced by Pepper (with and without contextual movement) and to visualize both the front and bottom 2D cameras. Aditionally, it now supports all preloaded animations, changes in the speed movement and the functionality to execute a Script. Finally, it also allows the user to select a set of sensors and visualize it using Rviz.

It is currently compatible with robot_toolkit V0.8*
